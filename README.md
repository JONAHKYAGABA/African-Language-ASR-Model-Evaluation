# üåç African Language ASR Model Evaluation

This project provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models on low-resource African languages such as **Amharic**, **Oromo**, and **Shona**. It computes evaluation metrics like **Word Error Rate (WER)** and **Character Error Rate (CER)** and supports batch inference on Hugging Face models.

## üéØ Objectives

- Load ASR models from Hugging Face (Whisper, MMS, Wav2Vec2, etc.)
- Preprocess African-language datasets
- Run automatic speech recognition inference
- Compute and log WER and CER metrics
- Save detailed CSV reports of predictions
